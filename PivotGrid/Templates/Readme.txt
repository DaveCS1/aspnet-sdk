This example demonstrates the RadPivotGrid templates which can be instantiated in the row, column, and data tables. For the purpose of this example, all Quantity values lower than 40 are displayed with an exclamation mark.
Please try to click on any (row header, column header, or data) cell which will show a popup exposing different information available to the developers when using RadPivotGrid templates. This demo could also help you determine which template is instantiated in a given cell.
It is important to note that due to the nature of this control, the usual Eval approach for extracting the cell value won't work. Instead, one could use the Container.DataItem property to get hold of the underlying cell value.
