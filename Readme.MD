#ASP.NET SDK

The ASP.NET SDK is an easy-to-use infrastructure with developer focused examples for some of the Telerik's ASP.NET Ajax controls.
Every control has its own folder with subfolders that contain the actual sample. 
Every sample has readme.txt file that describes it in few sentences.

##HOW TO RUN SAMPLES:

1) Using Visual Studio open a sample as a web site.
2) Add references to Telerik.Web.UI and Telerik.Web.UI.Skins
3) Build and run the web site.

##IMPORTANT:

Some samples can only run under .NET 45. Should this is the case there will be note in the Readme.txt of the given sample.
