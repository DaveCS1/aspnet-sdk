This example demonstrates how to persist the selected items in a hierarchical RadGrid.When all items on a particular level are selected the parent item should also be selected.
If one of the items on the level is not selected the parent item should not be selected as well. 
In order for the algorithm to work correctly each GridTableView should have DataKeyNames and Name set.
