The purpose of the project is to illustrate how you could use RadGrid or any other
databound control with the different options for binding like Entity Framework, LinqToSql,
OpenAccess, XML, and custom classes.

Majority of the tools and products used in this project are freely available either from the Microsoft web site 
or from Telerik web site.

The project was built using .NET 4.0 and Visual Studio 2010. This desicion was made because of compatibility 
reasons. The solution could be easily converted to Visual Studio 2012 and .NET 4.5 if needed.

All models are using Northwind sample database for data provider as it is freely available for download from Microsoft.

For the XML model the SouthWind implementation of the Northwind database was used. It is available for download from here:

For the OpenAcces model you should have installed the OpenAccess product from Telerik, version 2013.2.611.1 or later.
