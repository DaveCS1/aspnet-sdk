This example demonstrates how to export the RadGrid directly on server. From the dropdown list you could choose the export file type and by 
clicking on the generate file button the corresponding file will be exported on the servet.
When a file does not exist on the server the download buttons will not be visible. If there is already exported file you could choose
whether you want to download the file or open it inside the browser.
